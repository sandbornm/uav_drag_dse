Is it possible to run the drag model for a single component of the vehicle  (e.g. prop, cylinder, wing)

- single prop + motor: works (error line 1494 concatenate meshes out of bounds index without including motor); is  
- single tube: works
- single wing: works

- the flow_face() function on line 86 takes as input mesh facets and mesh normals to obtain the length, width, and thickness of the component mesh
- flow_face is called for the components: ESC, Flange, Plate, Wings, non AeroShell
- flow_face is NOT called for components: tube, motor, fuse_capsule, props

Drag is computed for a component in the following steps:
1. mesh2cad rotation matrix is constructed based on component's CAD parameters
2. trimesh.creation.<shape> is called using this matrix and parameters
3. Tform is applied to the new mesh which concatenates translation and rotation matrices
4. the front face is then determined using mesh facet normals `front_index = np.argmax(mesh.facets_normal[:, 0])`
5. the `flow_face()` function is called as `leng, wid, thi = flow_face(mesh.facets_origin, mesh.facets_normal)` and returns the flow face dimensions
6. the flow face dimensions are then provided as input to the drag surrogate function, for example `cd, cl, cf, warea = platedrag( leng / 1000, thi / 1000, wid / 1000, mesh.facets_normal[front_index,], ang, vel, mu, rho, q)`. The `flow_face()` is only called for "boxy" objects (ESC, Flange, Plate, Wing). When it is called by default, the corresponding CAD part is assumed to be a box.
7. Calculate drag moments and total drag
